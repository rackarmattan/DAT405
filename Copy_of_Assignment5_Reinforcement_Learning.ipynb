Recall that for a policy to be optimal, it must satisfy the Bellman equation above, meaning that plugging in a given candidate $V^*$ in the right-hand side (RHS) of the Bellman equation should result in the same $V^*$ on the left-hand side (LHS). This property will form the basis of our algorithm. Essentially, it can be shown that repeated application of the RHS to any intial value function $V^0(s)$ will eventually lead to the value $V$ which statifies the Bellman equation. Hence repeated application of the Bellman equation will also lead to the optimal value function. We can then extract the optimal policy by simply noting what actions that satisfy the equation. The process of repeated application of the Bellman equation what we here call the _value iteration_ algorithm."

Q-learning is then a method that allows the agent to act optimally. Here we will focus on the simplest form of Q-learning algorithms, which can be applied when all states are known to the agent, and the state and action spaces are reasonably small.

This can be seen by the policy printed, which tells us that ‘move’, i.e. “go to right”, should be done 5 times, and then ‘stay’ after that. Our Q-table converges to the same conclusion, that it is the best option to do action 0 (move to the right and then stay at 5) in each state. \n",

If the agent would always do so in the chain example, the agent would always choose to go to 1 in space 1, as that generates the highest Q-value. With permission to explore other alternative actions, the algorithm has the possibility to find ways that could lead to higher rewards in the long-term. It will also explore a lot more of the space-action combinations than if just choosing the next best action every time. \n"
